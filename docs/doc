We use google vision api which analyse the pictures and send us the results. This api will output the safe_search api which is basically
if the picture is violent, for adults, about injuries(medical) and inappropriate context overall. There are some other data but these data 
are the most useful to do further steps. The first verion of google vision api code is to use the labels api which just describes what 
is shown in the picture with basic labels.

We did not consider other same type of api yet because google vision seems to be working pretty well, 
and the way to manage the result is clear.

---2018.3.28 Update---
We add Instagram api and create a webpage. The Instagram api is hard to use so we consider first hard-code the pictures and connect 
Instagram and google vision. Which means we do not need the user to input a user name but just use several pictures we prepared.(demo version)
The webpage alpha version is just a skeleton to present the result but nothing else.
