Ideas:


1.
Create an algorithm to calculate a person's criminal or lucidity level from his or her data from the websites. 
Combine it with personality API, Instagram API and so on.


2.
Using [personality API (traitify)] and [API like NY Times] to match movies/books/Universities and some others to fit this personsâ€™ personality. 
Or we can grab data from social medias or Reddit to expand this idea.
