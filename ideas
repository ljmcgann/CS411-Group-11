Ideas:

1.(main)
Create an algorithm to calculate a person's criminal or lucidity level or mental states from his or her data from the websites. 
Combine it with personality API, Instagram API and so on. We can check the words in their posts and the photos on their Instagram accounts.
The filters they use and the tone of the photos and the frequency of some key words  can be parameters of the algorithm.


2.
Using [personality API (traitify)] (or plus face recognition API) and [API like NY Times] to match movies/books/Universities and some others to fit this personsâ€™ personality. 
We can grab data from social medias or Reddit to expand this idea.
