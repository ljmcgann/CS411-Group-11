Ideas:

1.(main)
Create an algorithm to calculate a person's crime index or lucidity level or mental states from his or her data from the websites 
using personality API, Instagram API and so on. We can check the words in their posts and the photos on their Instagram accounts. 
The filters they use, the tone of the photos and the frequency of some key words can be the parameters of the algorithm.


2.
Using [personality API (traitify)] (or plus face recognition API) and [API like NY Times] to match movies/books/Universities 
and other related things to fit this personsâ€™ personality. We can grab data from social medias or Reddit to expand this idea.
